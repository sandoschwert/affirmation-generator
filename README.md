This is the team project repository for the Affimation Generator REST service

---

###**Problem Statement**
With an increase of screen time it's harder to get positive affirmations from the 
people who physically surround you in  life. The positive affirmation generator is a tool to get a 
healthy dose of self-confidence and motivation in your life though the screens we love in an effort ot create the positive support one needs to succeed in all areas of life. You can do it!

###**Project Objectives**
*Must Haves*
* Search for an affirmation by category or popularity
* Up vote or down vote affirmations
* Add your own affirmations to the db

*Nice to Haves*
* Personalize your affirmation
* Generate a random affirmation (choose naughty or nice!)
